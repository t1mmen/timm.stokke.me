It was embarrassing to realize my personal web presence for the past 7 years has been an outdated photo with a `@todo` note, so I slapped something together based on <a href="https://leerob.io">leerob.io</a>'s graciously shared open-source homepage.

Mostly because I couldn't be bothered to build the millionth website of my career, and I wanted a place to output thoughts.

Actual thoughts to come.
